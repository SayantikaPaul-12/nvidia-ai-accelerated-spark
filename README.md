# 🤖 AI Tutor – Accelerated Learning System for Data Science

An AI-powered tutoring system designed to accelerate learning in **Data Science** and **GPU Acceleration**, using a multi-agent architecture built on **Ollama LLM**. This platform supports interactive modes including Socratic guidance, real-time quizzes, GPU benchmarking, and video-based learning.

Developed as part of the **AI Spark Challenge** with NVIDIA and AZNext.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Mode-Based AI Tutoring
- **Socratic Tutor**  
  Encourages learners to reason through questions via guided prompts rather than direct answers.

- **General Assistant**  
  Provides concise, code-ready answers and explanations for technical topics in ML, data science, and programming.

- **GPU Accelerator**  
  Helps users convert CPU-bound code (e.g., NumPy, Pandas) to GPU-accelerated versions using CuPy, cuDF, etc. Includes benchmarking tools.

- **Quiz Mode**  
  Time-bound 10-question multiple-choice quizzes with instant scoring, answer explanations, weak point analysis, and upskilling recommendations.

- **Video Tutor**  
  Fetches and summarizes relevant tutorial videos from trusted sources (e.g., NVIDIA YouTube, technical conference talks).
